## Filament
It doesnâ€™t matter what material you use (PETG, ABS, PLA, etc.) or what color filament you use.  Use whatever filament you have on hand or can acquire quickly. If you have to purchase filament, PETG is preferred, but not necessary.

## Cleanup
My parts were quite stringy (a lot of fine fibers hanging off).  If your parts are a little stringy, please try to clean the strings off before dropping them off to us.

No sterilization is required as we will handle them carefully and the end user will sterilize them before using them.

Drop your printed parts off at Chase Oaks Church (281 Legacy Dr., Plano, TX 75023). There will be cardboard boxes under the covered walkway leading up to the main entrance on the Legacy Dr side of the building. Drop your prints in the boxes starting on Wednesday, April 8th or any day after this up until you receive an email stating that the need is over.
